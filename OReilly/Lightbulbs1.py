# With this mission I want to start a series of missions with light bulbs.
#They will help you understand the concept of processes and evaluation of the
#processesâ€™ performance. Instead of light bulbs, in real life,
#there may be equipment, the effectiveness of which must be calculated, or workers who go to work, and their wages must be calculated.

# The first mission is quite simple. There is a light bulb, which by default is off,
# and a button, by pressing which the light bulb switches its state.
#This means that if the light bulb is off and the button is pressed,
#the light turns on, and if you press it again, it turns off.
