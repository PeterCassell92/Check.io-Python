#  In the 4th mission of the series more light bulbs are added.

# You still must determine how long the room will be lit during the observation
#period between start_watching and end_watching. But now we have more than one light bulb.
#This means that in the light bulb switching array can now also be passed the number of the light bulb,
#the button of which is being pressed.

# Each element of the button clicking array can be either a datetime object
#(which means the time when the first button was pressed) or a tuple of 2 elements
#(where the first elements is a datetime object, the time the button was pressed),
#and the second is the number of the light bulb, the button of which is being pressed.

# If the passed array will only consist of datetime elements, then we have only one light bulb
# and the function should work the same way as in the previous mission of the series. 

# Taken from mission Lightbulb End Watching

#  In the third mission from the series about lightbulbs, I want to separately highlight the process and the period of observation of this process.

# In the previous mission, the start_watching parameter was introduced, and in this one - the end_watching parameter, which tells the time when it’s necessary to end the observation. If it’s not passed, the mission works as in the previous version, with no observation time limit.

# One more update is that the amount of elements (button clicks) can be odd (previously there was a precondition, that the amount of elements is always even).
